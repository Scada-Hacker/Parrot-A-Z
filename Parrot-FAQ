2. How can I log in as root ?

Short answer - you dont

It defeats the security model that's been in place for years. Applications are meant to be run with non-administrative privellages to prevent damagwe to the core OS. By running the system as root you could potentially allow an attacker to gain a ROOT shell and take over your system.

If this is asked persistently, please dont be offended if your message is removed, or you receive a warning.
